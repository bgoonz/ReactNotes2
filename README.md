# React Notes


### DOM Approach:
- DOM is a tree structure of HTML elements and we use javascript to modify the DOM.
- Working with the dom is relatively slow, whereas working with javascript objects is fast.



### React (Declaration) Approach:
- React is a javascript library for building user interfaces.
- React uses a declarative approach to build user interfaces.
- React uses a virtual DOM to keep track of changes and then updates the actual DOM.
